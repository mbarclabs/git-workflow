### **Overview**

Working with teams can be quite challenging if there is no process in place to review and check code before it is merged and more importantly to prevent nightmare of deploying untested, omnious code to production. So for your sake and other developers on team , we encourage that you utilize the tools and follow practices that streamline workflow from development to production. This document would outline how we at MBARC LABS, should follow code versioning process. 

The most important rule of this workflow, is that the developer who is writing the code is responsible for making sure it goes through the entire process smoothly and in a timely manner.

Other developers need to reach out and help in any way possible, even if it's not a piece of code you have worked on in the past or the code is in a language you don't know.
